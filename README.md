# MVSNet -- by xuyi ~
**models/model.py** contains the main implementation of the MVSNet architecture,
which includes :

    1. differentiable homography
    2. feature colume warping
    3. cost volume aggregation
    4. depth map generation

Each module and step has clear comments to explain the operation,
which can show **my own understanding** of this problem.

If you would like to reproduce results, please run 
``` bash eval2_bottle.sh ```

The pre-generated result files are stored in **outputs_final**. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask :)
